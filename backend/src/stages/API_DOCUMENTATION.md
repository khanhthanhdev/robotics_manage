# Stage Advancement API Documentation

## Overview

The Stage Advancement API provides endpoints for managing tournament stage progression, team advancement, and ranking systems. All endpoints follow RESTful conventions and implement proper authorization.

## Base URL
```
/stages
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication using JWT tokens. Stage advancement operations require `ADMIN` role.

## Error Responses

All endpoints return consistent error responses:

```typescript
{
  success: false;
  message: string;
  error: string;
}
```

### Common Error Status Codes

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid parameters, validation errors, business logic violations
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication token
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions (e.g., non-admin trying to advance teams)
- `404 Not Found`: Stage not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side errors

### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Cannot advance 10 teams when only 8 teams participated in the stage",
  "error": "ValidationError"
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Stage Advancement
- `teamsToAdvance`: Must be between 1 and 100
- Cannot advance more teams than participated in the stage
- All matches in the stage must be completed
- Stage must be in `ACTIVE` status
- Cannot specify both `nextStageId` and `createNextStage`
- When `createNextStage` is true, `nextStageConfig` is required

### Next Stage Configuration
- `name`: Required, 1-100 characters
- `type`: Must be valid enum value (`SWISS`, `PLAYOFF`, `FINAL`)
- `endDate`: Must be after `startDate`
- `teamsPerAlliance`: Must be between 1 and 10

## Business Logic

### Ranking System
Teams are ranked using the following criteria in order of priority:
1. Ranking Points (primary)
2. Point Differential
3. Points Scored
4. Tiebreaker 1 (configurable metric)
5. Tiebreaker 2 (configurable metric)

### Stage Status Transitions
- Stage starts as `ACTIVE`
- When teams are advanced, the stage becomes `COMPLETED`
- Completed stages cannot be advanced again

### Team Advancement
- Teams' `currentStageId` is updated to point to the next stage
- Only top-ranking teams are advanced
- Operation is atomic (all changes in database transaction)

## Integration Examples

### Complete Workflow
```javascript
// 1. Check if stage is ready
const readiness = await fetch('/stages/stage-123/readiness');
if (!readiness.data.ready) {
  console.log('Stage not ready:', readiness.data.reason);
  return;
}

// 2. Preview advancement
const preview = await fetch('/stages/stage-123/advancement-preview?teamsToAdvance=8');
console.log(`Would advance ${preview.data.teamsToAdvance.length} teams`);

// 3. Advance teams
const result = await fetch('/stages/stage-123/advance', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    teamsToAdvance: 8,
    nextStageId: 'stage-456'
  })
});

console.log(`Advanced ${result.data.totalTeamsAdvanced} teams`);
```

This API provides comprehensive stage management capabilities with proper validation, error handling, and preview functionality for tournament administrators.
